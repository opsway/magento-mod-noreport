magento-mod-noreport
====================

This module blocks native Magento report functionality that store lot of different events taking a lot of place in DB.
Normally these events are used to build custom reports. However this data can be obtained with simple classic SQL queries or via
integration of 3rd party systems like Xiti, GA, etc.
